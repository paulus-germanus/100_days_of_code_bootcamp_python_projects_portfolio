Hail be to thee and all thy kin, O!, [NAME]! at this day of commemoration of thy womb-emergence!

May the bodily emanation of your unwavering spirit be always smooth and devoid of warts and such,
may your facial growth protrude forwards unimpeded by the pesky blades of them cowardly, beardless, scurvy-ridden, mudheaded weaklings,
and may your ways be always straight, overgrown with the softest of grass, sprinkled with the freshest of dew, and fringed with the most weeping of willows,
and to make the most of that: may your callusless feet be the barest of all feet!

Oh, and remember: Be adequate! #halflife2
